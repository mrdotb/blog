## Resume

Hi, I am Baptiste Chaleil also known as mrdotb. I live in Paris, France.

I am a software developer specialized in development of web applications. I love to develop. I care about UX, responsiveness, performance, maintainability and scalability.

When I am not working I like to travel around the world and tinker my [~dotfiles](https://github.com/mrdotb/dotfiles).

I run [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) on my desktop computer and [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/) on my laptop, both with the [i3](https://i3wm.org/) window manager.

## Resume

Hi, I am Baptiste Chaleil also known as mrdotb. I currently live in Chiang Mai, Thailand.

I am a software developer from Paris specialized in development of web applications.

I attended 42 school.

I run [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) on my desktop computer and [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/) on my laptop, with the [i3](https://i3wm.org/) window manager. I like tinkering my [~dotfiles](https://github.com/mrdotb/rice).

Currently, I try to improve my knowledge about computer science...
